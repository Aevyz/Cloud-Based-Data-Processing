# Scalable Systems

## Distributed Computing Challenges

Ideally adding N servers allows the service to support m*N users. 

Linear scalability is hard to achieve because...

* Overheads and synchronization is needed
* Load imbalances create hot spots
  * Popular content
  * Poor hash functions
* Amdahl's law
  * A straggler slows everything down

### Challenges

#### Scalability

::: define Scalability
Independent parallel processing of tasks / sub-requests ==> Can add additional servers for further concurrency
:::

#### Fault Tolerance

::: define Fault Tolerance
Must be able to handle and recover from both software and hardware failures. Services and data must be replicated for redundancy. 
:::

::: define High Availibility
Service must have 100% 24/7 uptime
:::

::: define Consistency
Data stored/produced by the services must be consistent
:::

::: define Performance
Predictable low latency processing with high throughput
:::

### Amdahl's Law
In general terms, Amdahlâ€™s Law states that in parallelization, if P is the proportion of a system or program that can be made parallel, and 1-P is the proportion that remains serial, then the maximum speedup S(N) that can be achieved using N processors is:
                `S(N)=1/((1-P)+(P/N))`
As N grows the speedup tends to 1/(1-P).
 
Speedup is limited by the total time needed for the sequential (serial) part of the program. For 10 hours of computing, if we can parallelize 9 hours of computing and 1 hour cannot be parallelized, then our maximum speedup is limited to 10 times as fast. If computers get faster the speedup itself stays the same.
